# Brain-Therapy-for-Stress-Related-Disease

We want to create a new category of care to treat a condition that the healthcare system ignores: a chronically-activated stress response. This condition affects millions of patients and costs the healthcare system billions of dollars every year. A chronically-activated stress response is a contributing factor to all chronic diseases. However, none of the 86% of all healthcare dollars spent on treating chronic diseases is aimed specifically at improving patientsâ€™ responses to stress. Fortunately, a chronically-active stress response can be safely reversed by non-invasively remodeling how the brain deals with stress. This investment aims to do this in a unique way using virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback.
